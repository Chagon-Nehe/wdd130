                Malawi, located in southeastern Africa, is a landlocked nation characterized by its highland terrain, divided by the Great Rift Valley. 
                One of its most prominent features is the vast Lake Malawi. 
                The southern region of the lake is encompassed by Lake Malawi National Park, which is home to a variety of wildlife, including vibrant fish species and baboons. 
                The lake's pristine waters are favored for activities such as diving and boating. 
                Additionally, Cape Maclear, a peninsula, is renowned for its beach resorts.
