            <p>My name is <b>Chawanangwa Gondwe</b>, and I'm a dedicated healthcare professional with a diverse and impressive background. 
                
                I graduated from the University of Malawi at Kamuzu College of Nursing (now Kamuzu University of Health Sciences) with a BSc in Nursing and Midwifery in 2016. <P>My career journey began as a research nurse with the College of Medicine in Malawi,
                where I worked for 2 years, contributing to significant medical research.

                Currently, I am a registered nurse/midwife working at Kamuzu Central Hospital in the medical ward, where I provide compassionate and high-quality care to my patients.</P> My passion for healthcare extends beyond the clinical setting, 
                
                in addition to my medical expertise, I have a strong interest in technology. I'm studying for a bachelor's degree in Software Development at BYU-Idaho, aiming to integrate my knowledge of healthcare with cutting-edge tech solutions. 
                I recently with a scholarship from Indian Ministry of External Affairs, I completed an MBA in Hospital Administration from JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, India, Mysore in 2023, further equipping me with the skills to manage and innovate within healthcare institutions.
                
                <p>I am fascinated by the potential of technology to revolutionize patient care and streamline decision-making processes. My goal is to leverage this knowledge to develop innovative health tech solutions that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery</p>
